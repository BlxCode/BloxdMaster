     <body><p>So you know the iron watermelon? It is the most scariest and the first mob in bloxd.io. Kinda like herobrine in mc. It could just be a prank, or a hoax. But here is what I know. The Iron watermelon was created because the bloxd.io servers were small. And gong out far away from spawn will fill up memory because of the chunks loaded. And so to prevent the server from restarting every like 1 second, Arthur: the creator of bloxd added a nice little jump scare to make them exit/run backwords to prevent them from going out too far. The Iron Watermelon would appear on the screen when you go out too far.
